Drone Pilot Management System for Drone Solutions Zimbabwe: Project Overview and System Analysis

Chapter 1: Project Overview

1.1. Introduction

The global drone industry has witnessed exponential growth in recent years, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) being adopted across a multitude of sectors. In Zimbabwe, as elsewhere, drones are increasingly utilized in diverse applications such as precision agriculture, mining surveys, infrastructure surveillance, and media production.1 This rapid proliferation of drone technology brings forth significant operational benefits, including enhanced data collection, improved efficiency, and access to previously unreachable areas. However, this technological advancement also introduces new complexities, particularly in the management of drone operations.

A critical challenge emerging from this growth is the efficient and compliant management of drone pilots and their associated activities. As organizations expand their drone fleets and pilot rosters, traditional methods of tracking pilot certifications, flight hours, mission assignments, and adherence to regulatory frameworks become increasingly cumbersome and prone to error. The need for robust systems to manage these aspects is paramount, not only for operational efficiency but also for ensuring safety and compliance with aviation authorities.1 Many organizations are finding that their adoption of drone technology for its immediate benefits has outpaced the development of sophisticated backend management practices, creating an operational gap.

This capstone project addresses these challenges through the design, development, and evaluation of a Drone Pilot Management System (DPMS). The system is specifically tailored to the needs of Drone Solutions Zimbabwe, a key player in the nation's drone services sector. The core purpose of this project is to provide Drone Solutions with a centralized, automated, and user-friendly web-based platform to streamline the management of its drone pilots, their qualifications, flight activities, and ensure unwavering compliance with regulatory mandates. This initiative targets a tangible operational pain point, thereby offering practical value that extends beyond a purely academic exercise and directly contributes to enhancing the company's operational capabilities and regulatory adherence.1

1.2. Organisational Background: Drone Solutions Zimbabwe

Drone Solutions Zimbabwe stands as a prominent provider of drone technology and associated services within Zimbabwe, catering to a wide array of industries.1 The company's guiding vision is "pioneering the harnessing of UAV’s as an innovative tool to solve modern day problems in various sectors of the economy".2 This mission underscores their commitment to leveraging cutting-edge drone capabilities to address contemporary challenges and enhance operational efficiencies for their clientele.

The company offers a comprehensive suite of services, demonstrating its broad expertise in the UAV domain. These services include the sale of advanced drones, featuring models such as the DJI T40, Mavick 3 Pro, and M300 RTK, alongside drone repair services and professional drone pilot training programs.2 A significant portion of their operations is dedicated to sophisticated surveying services, encompassing aerial and ground surveys, underground surveys, and bathymetric surveys. Furthermore, Drone Solutions provides specialized services tailored to the agricultural sector, highlighting their adaptability to diverse industry needs.2 This diverse service portfolio, which also extends to media production and surveillance 1, implies a complex operational landscape. Managing pilots with varied skill sets, certified for different drone types (e.g., agricultural spraying drones versus high-precision survey drones), and deployed across numerous client projects with distinct requirements, necessitates a meticulous and robust management framework.

Drone Solutions primarily serves clients in the mining sector, boasting an impressive roster of high-profile companies including Zimplats, ZCDCO, Wattle, Shamva Mining, RioZim, Pan African Resources, Mimosa, Freda Rebecca, Metcorp, Caledonia Mining, Hwange Colliery, Bindura Nickel, Anjin Mining, and Anglo American.2 In addition to its commercial clientele, the company also provides drone solutions to government agencies, further broadening its operational scope.1

A cornerstone of Drone Solutions' operational philosophy is its unwavering commitment to safety and regulatory compliance. The organization ensures that all its pilots are certified and adhere to the standards stipulated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ).1 This commitment is particularly significant given the stringent nature of aviation regulations and underscores the critical importance of the proposed DPMS's compliance-centric features. Failure to adhere to CAAZ regulations, such as those detailed in Statutory Instrument 271 of 2018 3, could result in severe penalties, including fines or the suspension of operations, making a system that supports and documents compliance indispensable for maintaining their operational license and industry reputation.

The impetus for developing a DPMS stems directly from the company's growth. As Drone Solutions has expanded its drone fleet, trained more pilots, and undertaken an increasing number of operations, the manual or semi-manual methods for managing pilot certifications, flight schedules, and ensuring compliance have become progressively complex and challenging.1 This operational reality, driven by the "increase in operations and the number of pilots" 1, rather than merely the overall company headcount (on which specific data is unavailable 2), has created an urgent need for an efficient, centralized digital solution. The DPMS is envisioned to address these burgeoning complexities and support the company's continued growth and commitment to excellence.

1.3. Problem Statement

The rapid expansion of drone utilization across multiple sectors, a trend actively embraced by Drone Solutions Zimbabwe, has introduced significant challenges in the effective management of drone pilots, their certifications, and operational assignments.1 Current manual or disparate semi-automated processes for tracking pilot qualifications, logging flight hours, managing mission schedules, and ensuring adherence to regulatory mandates are frequently inefficient, time-consuming, and inherently susceptible to errors.1 This reliance on manual systems not only burdens administrative staff but also curtails operational agility and responsiveness.

The primary and most critical consequence of these inefficiencies is a substantially increased risk of non-compliance with stringent aviation and data protection regulations. For Drone Solutions, this specifically pertains to the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ) Statutory Instrument (SI) 271 of 2018, which governs all aspects of Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) operations, including pilot licensing, operator responsibilities, and detailed record-keeping.3 The complexity of SI 271 of 2018, particularly its extensive requirements for maintaining comprehensive records for pilots (logbooks), operators (pilot qualifications, training records, flight and duty times), and the drones themselves (maintenance logs linked to flight operations) 4, makes manual compliance an exceedingly challenging and error-prone undertaking. Failure to meet these obligations can lead to significant legal and financial repercussions, including substantial fines or even imprisonment as outlined in the regulations.4

Furthermore, the management of pilot data, which includes Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and sensitive details such as medical certifications, falls under the purview of Zimbabwe's Data Protection Act (e.g., Chapter 12:07).5 Manual systems often lack the necessary security and access control mechanisms to adequately protect this data, thereby exposing Drone Solutions to risks of data breaches and non-compliance with data privacy mandates, which also carry legal penalties.6 The problem, therefore, extends beyond operational inconvenience into realms of significant legal and financial risk.

The absence of a centralized, integrated system results in a lack of a single, authoritative source of truth for pilot data. This fragmentation makes it difficult for Drone Solutions' management to gain an accurate, real-time overview of pilot availability, current qualifications, flight hour accumulations, and overall operational readiness. Such a deficiency directly impacts informed decision-making, particularly in resource allocation and mission planning.

Inefficient scheduling mechanisms and a lack of clear visibility into pilot status can also lead to operational bottlenecks and mission delays. More critically, these shortcomings can inadvertently compromise safety if, for instance, a pilot who is not current with certifications or has exceeded flight hour limitations is assigned to a mission. Any safety incident or regulatory breach could severely damage Drone Solutions' reputation, particularly with its high-profile mining clients and its standing with CAAZ.2

Consequently, there is an undeniable and urgent need for a sophisticated digital solution. A centralized, automated Drone Pilot Management System is required to simplify the complexities of managing drone pilots, provide a robust platform for tracking their credentials and flight operations, ensure operational safety, and, crucially, maintain demonstrable compliance with all pertinent regulatory bodies.1

1.4. Project Aim

To design, develop, and evaluate a secure and user-friendly web-based Drone Pilot Management System (DPMS) for Drone Solutions Zimbabwe. This system will streamline the comprehensive management of drone pilots, including the meticulous tracking of certifications and their respective expiry dates, systematic logging of flight hours and mission details, efficient assignment of pilots to specific drone missions based on qualifications and availability, and robust assurance of compliance with the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ) regulations (SI 271 of 2018) and the Zimbabwe Data Protection Act.1 The inclusion of "evaluation" is critical, as a key component of this capstone project involves demonstrating that the developed system effectively meets its stated goals and addresses the identified problems. Furthermore, explicitly naming CAAZ SI 271 of 2018 and the Zimbabwe Data Protection Act within the aim underscores their fundamental importance to the project's design and functionality, as these regulations are primary drivers for many of the system's requirements.

1.5. Project Objectives

To achieve the overall project aim, the following specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives have been defined. These objectives build upon the initial outline 1 and are expanded to reflect the necessary academic rigor and technical depth for a capstone project:

Design and Develop a Secure Web-Based Application: To architect and implement a robust, secure, and scalable web-based application. This will involve utilizing contemporary front-end frameworks (e.g., React.js or Vue.js for a responsive user interface) and back-end technologies (e.g., Node.js with Express.js, or suitable alternatives like Python with Django/Flask for server-side logic and API development). The application must ensure cross-browser compatibility and a responsive design for accessibility across various devices.1

Integrate a Centralized Database System: To design, develop, and integrate an efficient and secure database system (e.g., a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL for structured data and relationships, or a NoSQL database like MongoDB for flexibility if deemed appropriate). This database will serve as the central repository for persistent storage and effective management of comprehensive pilot information (including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and contact details), detailed flight logs, pilot certification records, drone fleet data, and mission assignment details.1

Implement Robust User Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): To develop a secure user authentication mechanism (e.g., employing token-based authentication such as JWT, or leveraging OAuth 2.0 if integration with other services is envisioned) and implement granular RBAC. This will ensure that different user categories—specifically administrators, pilots, and potentially regulatory officers (or a management role with read-only access to certain reports)—have appropriately defined access levels to system functionalities and sensitive data, adhering to the principle of least privilege.1

Create a Pilot Certification Tracking Module with Automated Alerts: To design and implement a dedicated module for the meticulous tracking of various pilot certifications (e.g., Remote Pilot License (RPL), medical certificates, drone-specific type ratings, radiotelephony licenses). This module will manage certification validity periods and automatically generate timely email and/or in-system notifications to both pilots and administrators regarding upcoming certification expiries and renewal requirements, referencing CAAZ guidelines for renewal timelines where applicable.1

Develop a Comprehensive Flight Logging and Reporting System: To build an intuitive system enabling pilots to accurately input their flight hours and essential mission details (including date, drone registration, location, flight duration, pilot-in-command status, co-pilot details if any, nature of flight/mission, and any pertinent operational conditions or incidents). Administrators must have the capability to access, review, and approve these logs, and the system must facilitate the generation of customized reports from this data for internal operational analysis, pilot performance reviews, and to support CAAZ compliance documentation.1

Build an Intelligent Drone and Pilot Scheduling System: To create an efficient scheduling module that allows administrators to assign certified and available drones and pilots to specific missions or flights. This system will consider pilot qualifications (ensuring they are rated for the specific drone and mission type), drone suitability and availability, pilot flight hour limitations (to prevent fatigue), and other operational demands to optimize resource allocation.1

Ensure Regulatory Compliance and Data Protection: To systematically incorporate features, validation checks, and data structures that ensure the system's operations and data management practices align with the requirements of CAAZ SI 271 of 2018 (e.g., specific data fields for pilot logbooks, operator record-keeping mandates) and the principles of the Zimbabwe Data Protection Act (e.g., secure handling and storage of PII, audit trails for data access, mechanisms supporting data subject rights where applicable). This objective includes the capability to generate reports formatted for compliance verification purposes.1 The system's design will be fundamentally influenced by these regulatory frameworks, making this objective a core principle guiding development rather than just an add-on feature.

Deploy the Application on a Cloud Platform: To successfully deploy the developed DPMS on a reputable, scalable, and reliable cloud computing platform (e.g., Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Heroku, or Google Cloud Platform). This deployment strategy aims to ensure high availability of the system, secure remote access for authorized users from various locations, and facilitate ease of ongoing maintenance, updates, and future scalability as Drone Solutions' needs evolve.1

Each of these objectives is designed to be directly testable and verifiable upon the project's completion, ensuring that the success of the DPMS can be objectively assessed against these predefined targets. The technology choices mentioned will be further justified in subsequent design-focused chapters of the project.

1.6. Feasibility and Planning

1.6.1. Feasibility Study

A comprehensive feasibility study is essential to assess the practicality and potential success of the Drone Pilot Management System project, considering various critical factors.7 This study evaluates the project's viability from technical, economic, operational, schedule, and legal perspectives.

Technical FeasibilityThe development of a web-based Drone Pilot Management System, as proposed, is technically feasible. The project leverages standard and widely accessible technologies, including modern JavaScript frameworks for the front-end, robust back-end technologies, and common database systems, as outlined in the project objectives.1 The student, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering (BSSEZ), is expected to possess the foundational knowledge and skills in software development, database management, and web technologies required for this undertaking. Furthermore, guidance from an academic supervisor will provide expert oversight and support.7 Access to necessary development tools, Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), version control systems, and cloud service platforms (many of which offer free or student-tier access) is readily available.However, several potential technical risks must be acknowledged:

Integration Challenges: Successfully integrating disparate components such as the front-end user interface, back-end application logic, the database, cloud deployment services, and any potential third-party APIs (e.g., for mapping or weather data, if considered in later project phases) can present complexities.7

Scalability Issues: The system must be architected to handle potential future growth in the number of pilots, drones, flight logs, and concurrent users at Drone Solutions. Ensuring the database schema and application logic can scale efficiently is a key consideration.7

Security Vulnerabilities: As a web-based application handling sensitive pilot PII (Personally Identifiable Information), certification details, and operational data, the DPMS will be a target for common web vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and others.10 Protecting this data against unauthorized access, modification, or breaches is paramount and directly links to legal compliance requirements under the Zimbabwe Data Protection Act.5

Data Migration: If Drone Solutions currently maintains pilot and operational records in existing digital formats (e.g., spreadsheets) or paper-based systems, migrating this historical data into the new DPMS could be a complex, time-consuming, and error-prone task requiring careful planning and execution.12

High-level mitigation strategies for these technical risks include adopting secure coding practices from the outset, implementing comprehensive testing methodologies (unit, integration, and security testing), designing the system with a modular architecture to facilitate easier integration and maintenance, and leveraging built-in security features of the chosen cloud platform and database system.

Economic FeasibilityFor a capstone project, a formal financial cost-benefit analysis is typically qualitative. The primary "cost" is the student's development time and intellectual effort. Direct financial outlays are expected to be minimal, assuming the use of open-source development tools, free or student-tier cloud services, and existing hardware.13For Drone Solutions, should the system be adopted post-development, the economic benefits are substantial:

Improved Operational Efficiency: Automation of currently manual tasks such as certification tracking, flight logging, pilot scheduling, and report generation will lead to significant time savings for administrative staff and pilots.15 This allows personnel to focus on more strategic, value-adding activities.

Reduced Errors: Minimizing human intervention in data entry and record-keeping drastically reduces the likelihood of errors, leading to more accurate and reliable operational data.15

Enhanced Regulatory Compliance & Avoided Costs: The DPMS is designed to streamline adherence to CAAZ SI 271 of 2018 and the Zimbabwe Data Protection Act. This significantly reduces the risk of costly fines, legal fees, and operational disruptions associated with non-compliance.18 For instance, penalties for non-registration of RPAs or fraudulent registration under CAAZ regulations can be severe 4, and the Data Protection Act also stipulates significant penalties for non-compliance.6 These "avoided costs" are a major component of the system's economic benefit.

Better Resource Utilization: Optimized scheduling capabilities ensure that pilots and drones are assigned efficiently, maximizing their utilization and potentially reducing the need for excessive overtime or unnecessary equipment acquisition.

Improved Data Accessibility and Reporting: A centralized database provides readily accessible information, enabling faster generation of comprehensive reports for management review, operational planning, and compliance audits.

Enhanced Safety and Accountability: By ensuring pilots are always correctly certified and appropriately assigned, the system contributes to overall operational safety. Detailed, auditable records enhance accountability across all drone operations.1

While a precise Return on Investment (ROI) calculation is beyond this project's scope, the qualitative benefits, particularly in terms of efficiency gains, risk reduction (both operational and legal), and enhanced compliance, strongly indicate a positive ROI for Drone Solutions upon potential implementation.13

Operational FeasibilityThe proposed DPMS is operationally feasible as it directly addresses the identified inefficiencies and risks within Drone Solutions' current pilot management practices.8 The system aims to solve critical problems related to manual process overheads, compliance tracking difficulties, and lack of centralized data.Stakeholder acceptance is a key factor:

Management: Acceptance from Drone Solutions' management is anticipated to be high, given the system's potential to mitigate significant business risks, improve efficiency, and provide better operational oversight. Their support is crucial for successful adoption.8

Pilots and Administrative Staff: Acceptance from end-users will depend heavily on the system's usability, intuitiveness, and the perceived benefits it offers over current methods. Resistance to change is a common challenge when introducing new software, especially if it disrupts established workflows or is perceived as complex.8 A user-centric design approach, coupled with clear demonstration of time-saving and simplification benefits, will be vital.

Other operational considerations include:

Training Requirements: Pilots and administrative staff will require adequate training to effectively use the new DPMS. The system should be designed to be as intuitive as possible to minimize the training burden.12

Integration with Existing Workflows: The DPMS should be designed to either seamlessly integrate with or efficiently replace existing manual processes, ensuring minimal disruption to Drone Solutions' day-to-day operations.

Resource Availability (Drone Solutions): It is assumed that Drone Solutions has the basic IT infrastructure, such as reliable internet access and computers for users, to support a web-based system.

Schedule FeasibilityThe project's scope, as defined by the objectives 1 and detailed further in this report, appears manageable within the typical timeframe allocated for an undergraduate capstone project (e.g., one to two academic semesters).13 Effective scope management will be critical to ensure timely completion.Potential risks to the schedule include:

Underestimation of the development time required for specific features or modules.

Encountering unforeseen technical challenges during implementation.

Delays in obtaining necessary information or feedback from stakeholders, if extensive interaction with Drone Solutions is planned and proves difficult to schedule.

Scope creep, where new requirements are added during development without proper assessment of their impact on the timeline.

Mitigation strategies include developing a realistic project plan with buffer time, prioritizing core functionalities, employing an agile-like iterative development approach to allow for flexibility, and maintaining regular communication with the project supervisor.

Legal/Compliance FeasibilityThe DPMS is fundamentally designed to support and enhance legal and regulatory compliance for Drone Solutions.

CAAZ SI 271 of 2018: The system's features for pilot licensing management, flight logging, and operator record-keeping will be directly mapped to the requirements outlined in this statutory instrument.3 This includes capturing specific data fields for pilot logbooks and maintaining records of pilot qualifications and training.

Zimbabwe Data Protection Act [Chapter 12:07] (and potentially associated regulations): The system will manage a significant amount of Pilot PII, including names, contact details, license numbers, and potentially sensitive data like medical certificate information. Therefore, the DPMS must be designed and developed with robust data security and privacy principles from the outset. This includes secure data storage, encryption of sensitive data, implementation of role-based access controls, audit trails for data access and modifications, and mechanisms to support data subject rights as mandated by the Act.5 While the DPMS itself will not make Drone Solutions fully compliant (as this involves broader organizational policies, DPO appointment, etc. 6), it will provide essential tools to support their data protection obligations for the data managed within the system. The interplay between CAAZ's data retention requirements (e.g., pilot logbooks) and the Data Protection Act's principles for handling PII within those records must be carefully navigated.

Intellectual Property: The intellectual property of the code developed by the student as part of the capstone project will typically reside with the student or the academic institution, as per university policy. Should Drone Solutions wish to use the system commercially post-project, a formal licensing agreement would be necessary. This is a standard consideration for industry-partnered capstone projects.

Risk Management (Initial Overview):Beyond the system-specific risks identified in the feasibility study, several project-level risks need consideration:

Scope Creep: The uncontrolled expansion of project requirements beyond the initially defined objectives, leading to potential delays and an unmanageable workload.23

Mitigation: Establish a clear baseline scope from the outset. Implement a formal (even if simplified for a student project) change request process for any proposed modifications, evaluating their impact on the timeline and resources. Regular reviews against the baseline objectives will be conducted.

Technical Skill Gap: Encountering development tasks or technologies that are more complex than initially anticipated or beyond the student's current skill set.

Mitigation: Proactive research and learning of required technologies. Leverage supervisor expertise for guidance on complex technical issues. If a feature proves overly complex, consider simplifying its implementation or deferring non-critical aspects, ensuring core objectives are met.

Time Constraints and Estimation Inaccuracies: Underestimating the time and effort required for various project tasks (design, coding, testing), leading to schedule slippage and pressure towards the end of the project lifecycle.13

Mitigation: Break down tasks into smaller, manageable units. Attempt realistic time estimation for each unit, potentially using techniques like PERT or by drawing on experience from previous academic projects. Build in some buffer time for unforeseen delays. Prioritize development of core, high-impact features first. Regular progress tracking against the project plan is essential.

Stakeholder Unavailability (If relying on Drone Solutions): Delays in obtaining necessary information, feedback on designs, or participation in UAT from Drone Solutions personnel due to their own operational priorities.

Mitigation: Develop a clear communication plan outlining when and what input is needed. Schedule interactions well in advance where possible. Have contingency plans for information gathering, such as relying more on publicly available data (like CAAZ regulations) or making well-documented assumptions if direct input is delayed.

A more detailed risk register will be maintained as part of ongoing project management activities, but these initial considerations will guide early planning. The project planning for this capstone acknowledges the typical constraints of a student project, primarily the individual nature of the effort and fixed academic timelines, by focusing on core deliverables and a manageable scope.

The following chapter will delve into a detailed analysis of the existing system and the specific requirements for the proposed DPMS.

Chapter 2: System Analysis

2.1. Data Gathering Methodologies Employed

The successful development of the Drone Pilot Management System (DPMS) hinges on a comprehensive understanding of Drone Solutions Zimbabwe's existing operational environment, specific user needs, and stringent regulatory obligations. To achieve this, a multi-faceted data gathering approach was employed, combining primary and secondary research techniques to collect both qualitative and quantitative information.25 The selection of these methodologies was driven by their respective strengths in eliciting different types of information crucial for this project.

Primary Data Collection:

Interviews: Semi-structured interviews were planned with key stakeholders at Drone Solutions. This method allows for in-depth exploration of topics, clarification of ambiguities, and the capture of rich qualitative insights into user requirements, current workflows, operational pain points, and expectations for the new system.25 The targeted stakeholders include:

Management: To understand strategic objectives, overarching compliance concerns (CAAZ and Data Protection Act), desired oversight capabilities, and key performance indicators for drone operations. Sample questions: "What are the most significant challenges Drone Solutions currently faces in managing its pilot roster and ensuring compliance with CAAZ regulations?" "From a strategic perspective, what are the key outcomes you expect a new DPMS to deliver in terms of reporting, efficiency, and risk mitigation?" "How critical is adherence to the Zimbabwe Data Protection Act in the management of pilot data, and what are your primary concerns in this area?".26

Drone Pilots: To gain first-hand accounts of daily operational procedures, difficulties encountered with current methods for logging flight hours, maintaining certification records, accessing mission schedules, and their specific needs and desired features in a new digital system. Sample questions: "Could you describe your current process for logging flight hours and submitting them?" "What are the main difficulties you face in keeping track of your various certifications and their expiry dates?" "What features in a digital pilot management system would make your flight preparation and post-flight reporting easier and more efficient?".28

Administrative Staff: To understand the current administrative workflows involved in pilot management, data entry processes, certification verification, report generation, and the time-consuming aspects or common errors encountered. Sample questions: "What are the most labor-intensive tasks in the current system for managing pilot records and certifications?" "What types of reports related to pilots and flights are you frequently asked to generate, and how is this currently done?"

Document Analysis: This involves a meticulous review of all available existing documentation pertinent to pilot management at Drone Solutions. This may include current forms used for flight logging or certification submission, any spreadsheets used for tracking, existing (if any) procedural manuals, and pilot logbook templates. Critically, this methodology extends to a thorough examination of regulatory and legal documents:

CAAZ Statutory Instrument 271 of 2018: This document is a primary source for extracting specific requirements related to Remote Pilot License (RPL) standards, RPA Operator Certificate (ROC) holder responsibilities, mandatory record-keeping for pilots (logbook contents), operators (personnel records, operational logs), and drones (technical logs), as well as flight operations logging protocols.3 For example, Section 14 of Part IV details pilot logbook requirements, and Section 23 of Part V outlines documentation and records for ROC holders.4

Zimbabwe Data Protection Act (e.g., Chapter 12:07): Analysis of this Act is crucial for understanding the legal obligations concerning the collection, processing, storage, and security of pilots' Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and any sensitive data (like medical certificate details) that the DPMS will handle.5 This informs data security features, access control mechanisms, and potentially consent management aspects of the system. Document analysis provides a vital baseline understanding of current processes (or lack thereof), identifies formal, non-negotiable requirements (especially regulatory ones), and helps in performing a gap analysis between the current state and the desired state.25

Observation (Limited Feasibility): Direct observation of current pilot management processes in action (e.g., how pilots submit logs, how administrators update certification records) can reveal practical nuances, informal workarounds, and operational inefficiencies that might not be fully captured through interviews or document analysis.25 However, due to the constraints of a student-led capstone project and potential limitations in accessing Drone Solutions' daily operations extensively, this method might be employed on a limited basis or supplemented by detailed process walkthroughs during interviews. Any limitations in conducting direct observation will be noted.

Secondary Data Collection:

Literature Review and Study of Existing Systems: Researching existing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or open-source drone pilot management systems, broader aviation crew management software 16, and relevant academic papers or industry reports on similar system implementations. This provides valuable insights into common functionalities, established best practices in user interface design for such systems, potential technical challenges, and innovative features that could be considered for the DPMS. This helps to avoid "reinventing the wheel" and informs the design with proven solutions.

The combination of these methodologies aims to ensure a comprehensive and well-rounded understanding, forming a solid foundation for the subsequent stages of system analysis and design. The emphasis on regulatory document analysis is particularly important, as compliance is a core driver for this DPMS project.

2.2. Description of Existing System (at Drone Solutions)

Based on initial information 1 and common practices within small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) managing specialized operational teams, the existing system for drone pilot management at Drone Solutions Zimbabwe is presumed to be a combination of manual processes, paper-based records, and potentially disparate digital tools like spreadsheets and email. This section describes the likely components and workflows of this current system, highlighting areas that the proposed DPMS aims to improve. It is important to note that the following description incorporates reasonable assumptions where specific details about Drone Solutions' internal processes were not explicitly available in the provided materials; these assumptions would be validated or refined during the detailed data gathering phase outlined in section 2.1.

Pilot Records Management:Currently, pilot personal details (name, contact information, addresses), employment information (employee ID, start date), and copies of licenses (RPL), medical certificates, drone-specific type ratings, and other qualifications are likely maintained through a combination of physical paper files and potentially basic spreadsheets. Each pilot's record might be a separate folder or a series of entries in a master spreadsheet managed by administrative staff. Updates to these records, such as changes in contact details or new qualifications, would probably require manual data entry. This fragmented approach often leads to data redundancy and inconsistencies if information is not updated uniformly across all records.1

Certification Tracking:The monitoring of expiry dates for critical pilot certifications (RPLs, medicals, specific endorsements) is a significant challenge in a manual system.1 It is likely that administrative staff rely on manual checks of records, calendar reminders (e.g., in Outlook or a physical diary), or individual pilot responsibility to track these dates. This method is highly susceptible to oversight, potentially leading to pilots operating with lapsed credentials, which carries severe compliance and safety risks. There is likely no automated, proactive system for generating renewal reminders to pilots or management.

Flight Hours Logging:Pilots at Drone Solutions are required to log their flight hours, a critical aspect for both individual currency and regulatory compliance.1 The current procedure likely involves pilots maintaining individual paper-based logbooks or, in some cases, personal digital spreadsheets. The data points captured might vary in consistency but would generally include date, aircraft registration, pilot-in-command (PIC), flight duration, departure/arrival locations, and possibly the nature of the mission. Section 14 of Part IV of CAAZ SI 271 of 2018 mandates specific details for pilot logbooks 4, and adherence to these specifics in a manual system can be inconsistent. The aggregation of this flight data for company records, payroll (if applicable), or compliance reporting would be a manual, time-consuming task for administrative staff, involving collecting and transcribing data from multiple sources.

Mission Scheduling and Assignment:The assignment of pilots to specific drone missions is probably handled through manual coordination. This could involve emails, phone calls, text messages, or shared online calendars. Determining pilot availability and suitability (i.e., ensuring they possess the correct qualifications and currency for the specific drone type and mission profile – e.g., agricultural spraying vs. mining survey) would rely on administrators cross-referencing various records, which can be inefficient and error-prone, especially under time pressure.

Drone Record Management (as it pertains to pilots):Tracking which pilot operated which specific drone for a particular mission, and for how long, is crucial for linking flight hours to individual airframes 4). In the current system, this information might be captured in pilots' individual flight logs or separate mission sheets, but a centralized, easily queryable record linking pilots, drones, and missions is likely absent.

Compliance Monitoring & Reporting:Ensuring and documenting ongoing compliance with CAAZ regulations (e.g., pilot flight and duty time limitations, recency requirements, adherence to operational rules during missions) is a significant undertaking with manual systems. Generating reports for internal audits or for submission to CAAZ (e.g., summaries of pilot qualifications, aggregated flight hours) would involve manually compiling data from various disparate sources, a process that is both labor-intensive and prone to inaccuracies.

Tools Used:The existing "system" likely relies heavily on standard office tools such as:

Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets for tracking pilot lists, certification dates, and possibly flight hours.

Paper-based forms for flight logging or data submission.

Physical filing cabinets for storing hard copies of licenses, medical certificates, and other documents.

Email and phone calls for communication regarding scheduling and updates.

Basic calendar applications for tracking some deadlines or schedules.

Data Flow (Informal):Information flow is probably ad-hoc. Pilots might submit paper logs or email spreadsheet updates to an administrator. The administrator then manually updates central records (if they exist) or files the paper documents. Management requests for reports would trigger a manual data compilation effort by the administrative staff. This lack of a structured, automated data flow contributes to delays and potential data loss or inconsistency. The overall picture is one of a system struggling with the "increase in operations and the number of pilots" 1, leading to the inefficiencies and regulatory risks previously identified.

2.3. Activity Diagram

UML Activity Diagrams are utilized here to model the flow of activities within key processes pertinent to drone pilot management. These diagrams visually represent the sequence of actions, decision points, and responsibilities of different actors (or system components), facilitating a clearer understanding of both existing manual processes and the streamlined workflows proposed with the new DPMS.30 Standard UML 2.x notation is employed, including initial and final nodes, action states, decision nodes, merge nodes, fork/join nodes for parallel activities, and swimlanes to delineate responsibilities.

Two representative processes have been chosen for modeling: the current manual process for pilot certification renewal and the proposed automated flight logging and approval process within the DPMS. These were selected because certification management and flight logging are core functions deeply impacted by the existing system's inefficiencies and are primary targets for improvement by the DPMS.





Process 1: Current Manual Pilot Certification Renewal Process (Illustrative)This activity diagram (Figure 2.3.1 - textual description follows) illustrates the typical manual steps involved when a pilot's certification (e.g., RPL, Medical) is due for renewal at Drone Solutions.

Swimlanes:

Drone Pilot

Administrator

Activity Flow Description (Figure 2.3.1):

The process begins with an Initial Node.

Administrator: The first action is Manually Check Certification Expiry Dates (e.g., from a spreadsheet or physical records).

A Decision Node follows: Is any certification nearing expiry?

If No, the flow proceeds to a Flow Final Node (for this checking cycle).

If Yes, the Administrator proceeds to Notify Pilot of Impending Expiry (e.g., via email or phone call).

Drone Pilot: Upon notification, the pilot undertakes the action Complete Renewal Process (this involves external actions like medical exams, CAAZ applications, etc.).

Drone Pilot: Next, the pilot Submits Renewed Certificate to Administrator (e.g., provides a scanned copy or physical document).

Administrator: The administrator receives the document and performs the action Verify Submitted Certificate.

A Decision Node follows: Is certificate valid and correct?

If No, the flow returns to the Administrator to Request Correction from Pilot, and the pilot would then need to re-address the issue.

If Yes, the Administrator performs the action Manually Update Pilot Record (e.g., in spreadsheet and/or physical file).

The process for this specific renewal concludes at an Activity Final Node.

Explanation: This diagram highlights several points of inefficiency and potential failure. The reliance on manual checks for expiry dates is error-prone. Communication for notification and submission is manual and can lead to delays. Verification and record updating are also manual, introducing further chances for error or delay. There's no automated tracking or escalation if a pilot fails to submit a renewed certificate on time.

Process 2: Proposed Automated Flight Logging and Approval Process (Illustrative)This activity diagram (Figure 2.3.2 - textual description follows) illustrates the streamlined workflow for flight logging and approval using the proposed Drone Pilot Management System.

Swimlanes:

Drone Pilot

DPMS (Drone Pilot Management System)

Administrator

Activity Flow Description (Figure 2.3.2):

The process begins with an Initial Node after a flight is completed.

Drone Pilot: The pilot performs the action Login to DPMS.

Drone Pilot: The pilot then Selects Flight Logging Module.

Drone Pilot: The pilot Enters Flight Details into the system's structured form (date, drone, PIC, times, location, mission type, etc.).

Drone Pilot: The pilot Submits Flight Log.

DPMS: The system automatically performs Validate Submitted Data (checks for completeness, valid formats, potential conflicts based on predefined rules).

A Decision Node within the DPMS: Does log pass auto-validation and meet auto-approval criteria? (e.g., within standard flight hour limits, no reported incidents).

If Yes (meets auto-approval criteria):

DPMS: The system Automatically Approves Flight Log.

DPMS: The system Updates Pilot's Flight Hours.

DPMS: The system Updates Drone's Usage Log.

DPMS: The system Notifies Pilot of Approval. The flow for this log then proceeds to an Activity Final Node.

If No (requires manual review or fails validation):

DPMS: The system Flags Log for Administrator Review.

DPMS: The system Notifies Administrator of Pending Review.

Administrator: The administrator performs Login to DPMS.

Administrator: The administrator Accesses Pending Flight Logs.

Administrator: The administrator Reviews Flight Log Details.

A Decision Node for the Administrator: Approve Flight Log?

If Yes:

Administrator: Approves Flight Log in System.

DPMS: The system Updates Pilot's Flight Hours.

DPMS: The system Updates Drone's Usage Log.

DPMS: The system Notifies Pilot of Approval. The flow proceeds to an Activity Final Node.

If No:

Administrator: Rejects Flight Log in System (providing reasons).

DPMS: The system Notifies Pilot of Rejection and Reasons. The pilot may then need to Correct and Resubmit Flight Log, re-entering the flow at step 4. The flow for this instance also proceeds to an Activity Final Node.

Explanation: This proposed process demonstrates significant improvements. Data entry is standardized. The DPMS handles initial validation and can auto-approve routine logs, reducing administrator workload.32 Notifications are automated. The system maintains a clear audit trail of submissions and approvals. This streamlined workflow reduces errors, saves time, and improves data accuracy. The level of detail is aimed at clearly communicating the process flow without becoming overly granular, aligning with the use of activity diagrams for understanding program flow at a reasonably high level.31

These activity diagrams visually articulate the current challenges and the benefits of automation that the DPMS will introduce, thereby justifying the system's development by clearly showing workflow progress and helping to identify and eliminate bottlenecks present in manual systems.30

2.4. Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) are used to model how data moves through the proposed Drone Pilot Management System (DPMS). They provide a visual representation of the system's inputs, outputs, processes that transform the data, and data stores where data is held.34 The Gane and Sarson notation will be used for these DFDs, where processes are represented by rectangles with rounded corners, data stores by open-ended rectangles, external entities by squares, and data flows by arrows.





2.4.1. Context Diagram (Level 0 DFD)

The Context Diagram (Figure 2.4.1 - textual description follows) provides the highest-level view of the DPMS. It depicts the entire system as a single process and shows its interaction with external entities.

Single Process: 0. Drone Pilot Management System

External Entities:

E1: Drone Pilot

E2: System Administrator (representing Drone Solutions administrative staff)

E3: Drone Solutions Management (representing management personnel requiring oversight information)

DF20: Regulatory_Updates_Input (Potentially from E2: System Administrator to P0: DPMS, if system allows manual input of new CAAZ rules affecting alerts/validations)

Explanation (Figure 2.4.1):The Context Diagram shows the DPMS as the central process. Drone Pilots interact with the system by submitting their registration details, flight logs, and certification updates, and in return, receive alerts, schedules, and confirmations. System Administrators manage user accounts, input and update pilot and drone data, create missions, configure the system, and receive detailed operational and system reports. Drone Solutions Management receives higher-level summary reports and compliance dashboards for oversight. The CAAZ is shown as an external entity receiving formatted compliance reports generated by the DPMS, which Drone Solutions would then submit. This diagram clearly defines the system's boundary and its primary interfaces with the outside world.34





2.4.2. Detailed DFD (Level 1 DFD)

The Level 1 DFD (Figure 2.4.2 - textual description follows) explodes the single Drone Pilot Management System process from the Context Diagram into its major sub-processes, showing the data flows between these processes, external entities, and key data stores. This provides a more granular view of the system's internal workings.

All Processes (P1.0-P6.0) -> DF7.1: Audit_Data -> P7.0 -> DF7.2: Logged_Audit_Entry -> D6: System_Audit_Trail_DB

Explanation (Figure 2.4.2):The Level 1 DFD breaks down the DPMS into key functional areas. For instance, P1.0: Manage Pilot & User Accounts handles all aspects of pilot registration, profile updates, and user credential management, interacting primarily with the D1: Pilot_Profiles_DB. P2.0: Track Certifications & Training interfaces with D2: Certifications_DB to monitor validity and trigger alerts via P6.0. P3.0: Log & Manage Flights is where pilots submit their flight data, which is stored in D3: Flight_Logs_DB and can be reviewed by administrators. P4.0: Schedule Missions & Resources draws on pilot and drone availability from D1 and D4 to populate D5: Mission_Schedules_DB. P5.0: Manage Drone Fleet Information ensures drone data in D4 is current for scheduling. P6.0: Generate Reports & Notifications is a crucial process that pulls data from various stores to create operational reports, management summaries, compliance documentation for CAAZ, and system alerts. The inclusion of P7.0: Maintain System Audit Logs and D6: System_Audit_Trail_DB is vital for a system managing sensitive and regulatory data, providing a record of significant system activities and data modifications, which supports accountability and data integrity requirements, particularly under the Zimbabwe Data Protection Act.5 The data stores are designed to reflect the scope of the system 1 and the specific record-keeping requirements mandated by CAAZ.4

These DFDs provide a clear visual model of the data interactions within the DPMS, serving as a foundational blueprint for subsequent database design and the logical structuring of system processes. Consistency in naming conventions between DFD components, requirements specifications, and the eventual system implementation will be maintained.

2.5. Weaknesses of Existing System

A thorough analysis of Drone Solutions' current pilot management approach, based on the description in section 2.2 and informed by common challenges faced by SMEs relying on manual or semi-automated systems 12, reveals several significant weaknesses. These shortcomings not only impede operational efficiency but also expose the organization to considerable compliance and safety risks.

Time-Consuming Manual Data Entry and Redundancy:A substantial amount of time is likely expended by both pilots and administrative staff on manually entering and, in many cases, re-entering the same data across multiple platforms or documents. For example, pilots might fill out paper flight logs, which are then manually transcribed into a spreadsheet by an administrator, who might also separately update pilot currency records. This duplication of effort is a major source of inefficiency.1

High Risk of Human Error and Data Inconsistency:Manual data entry is inherently prone to typographical errors, omissions, and calculation mistakes. When data is stored in disparate locations (e.g., individual pilot files, separate spreadsheets for certifications and flight hours), inconsistencies are almost inevitable. This leads to unreliable data, making accurate reporting and informed decision-making difficult.1

Ineffective Certification and Training Management:Proactively tracking the expiry dates of numerous pilot certifications (RPLs, medicals, type ratings, recurrent training) across an expanding pilot roster is a formidable task using manual methods. The absence of an automated alert system means that renewals might be overlooked, leading to last-minute rushes to revalidate or, in the worst-case scenario, pilots inadvertently operating with lapsed credentials, a serious breach of CAAZ regulations.1

Inefficient and Inaccurate Flight Hour Logging and Reporting:The current processes for pilots to log their flight hours are likely cumbersome, whether paper-based or reliant on individual spreadsheets. Consolidating this data for individual pilot summaries, company-wide operational analysis, payroll purposes (if applicable), or demonstrating compliance with flight and duty time limitations is a labor-intensive and error-prone task for administrators. Generating accurate and timely reports from such fragmented data is challenging.1

Suboptimal Pilot and Drone Scheduling:Without a centralized, real-time view of pilot availability, qualifications, currency, and drone operational status, scheduling missions efficiently is difficult. Administrators may struggle to quickly identify the most suitable and legally compliant pilot and drone for a specific mission, potentially leading to underutilization of resources, assignment of less-than-optimal personnel or equipment, or mission delays.

Lack of Centralized Data and Poor Visibility:Information critical to pilot management is likely scattered across various physical files, multiple spreadsheets, email chains, and individual calendars. This fragmentation means there is no single source of truth, making it extremely difficult for management to gain a holistic, up-to-date view of pilot status, overall drone usage patterns, and the company's compliance posture.1 This lack of visibility hampers strategic planning and rapid response to operational requirements or regulatory queries.

Compliance Challenges with CAAZ SI 271 of 2018:The detailed record-keeping requirements stipulated by CAAZ SI 271 of 2018 present a significant challenge for manual systems. This includes maintaining specific data fields in pilot logbooks (e.g., aircraft registration, PIC, nature of flight, incidents), comprehensive operator records (detailing pilot qualifications, training completion, flight and duty times), and RPAS technical logs.4 Manual systems struggle to ensure consistent capture of all required data and cannot easily provide the robust audit trails necessary to demonstrate compliance during CAAZ inspections.

Data Security and Privacy Risks (Zimbabwe Data Protection Act):Storing sensitive pilot Personally Identifiable Information (PII)—such as names, addresses, contact details, ID numbers, license details, and medical certificate information—in unsecured spreadsheets, accessible shared folders, or physical paper files poses significant data security and privacy risks. Such storage methods are vulnerable to unauthorized access, accidental disclosure, data loss, or malicious breaches, potentially leading to non-compliance with the Zimbabwe Data Protection Act, which mandates appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data.5 This can result in reputational damage, loss of client and pilot trust, and legal penalties.

Scalability Issues:As Drone Solutions continues to grow its pilot base, drone fleet, and volume of operations, all the aforementioned weaknesses of manual systems will be exacerbated. Manual processes that are manageable (albeit inefficiently) for a small team become completely untenable and increasingly risky as the scale of operations increases. The existing system lacks the inherent scalability of a dedicated digital solution.

The operational challenges faced by drone operators in Zimbabwe, such as complex licensing procedures and the need to maintain high safety standards 37, are compounded when internal management systems are inefficient. By addressing these internal weaknesses, the DPMS can free up valuable company resources, allowing Drone Solutions to better navigate the broader industry challenges.

The following table maps these weaknesses to the proposed solutions offered by the DPMS, highlighting the direct value of the new system:

2.6. Justification of Alternative Taken (Justification for the Proposed System)

The development of a custom, web-based Drone Pilot Management System (DPMS) is proposed as the most effective and appropriate solution to address the multifaceted challenges currently faced by Drone Solutions Zimbabwe. This justification builds upon the initial rationale 1 and is strongly supported by the detailed analysis of the existing system's weaknesses and the comprehensive benefits offered by the proposed alternative.

The proposed DPMS directly confronts and overcomes the critical weaknesses inherent in Drone Solutions' current manual or fragmented pilot management processes (as detailed in Section 2.5). By transitioning to a centralized, automated digital platform, Drone Solutions stands to gain significant advantages:

Improved Efficiency and Productivity: The automation of routine and time-consuming tasks—such as certification expiry tracking and alerts, flight log data entry and aggregation, pilot scheduling, and the generation of standard reports—will free up considerable time for both administrative staff and pilots. This allows personnel to redirect their efforts towards more strategic, value-added activities, thereby boosting overall productivity.15 For instance, the time saved from manually creating schedules or chasing pilots for logbook entries can be substantial.17

Enhanced Accuracy and Data Integrity: By minimizing manual data entry and implementing validation checks at the point of input, the DPMS will significantly reduce the incidence of human error. This leads to more accurate, consistent, and reliable data pertaining to pilots, certifications, and flight operations, which is crucial for sound decision-making and dependable compliance documentation.15

Strengthened Regulatory Compliance: A core benefit of the DPMS is its ability to facilitate and streamline adherence to the complex regulations set forth by the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ SI 271 of 2018) and the Zimbabwe Data Protection Act. The system will provide structured record-keeping aligned with CAAZ mandates, maintain audit trails, and incorporate security features essential for data protection compliance. This proactive approach to compliance minimizes the risk of costly penalties, operational disruptions, and reputational damage associated with regulatory breaches.1 The return on investment from compliance automation often includes the significant "avoided costs" of non-compliance.18

Centralized Management and Control: The DPMS will serve as a single source of truth for all pilot-related information. Authorized personnel will have access to up-to-date data on pilot qualifications, availability, flight history, and certification status from any location with internet access, enabling more effective management and control over drone operations.

Improved Reporting and Analytics: The system will empower Drone Solutions with the ability to generate comprehensive and customizable reports swiftly. These reports can provide valuable insights for operational analysis (e.g., pilot utilization, drone usage patterns), support compliance audits (e.g., demonstrating adherence to flight hour limitations or record-keeping standards), and inform management reviews and strategic planning.

Scalability for Future Growth: Unlike manual systems that become increasingly unwieldy with expansion, a well-architected web-based system is inherently more scalable. The DPMS can be designed to accommodate a growing number of pilots, a larger drone fleet, and an increasing volume of flight operations without a proportional increase in administrative burden.

Enhanced Safety and Accountability: By ensuring that pilots are always properly certified for their assigned tasks and that flight operations are meticulously logged and monitored, the DPMS contributes to a safer operational environment. Clear, accessible, and accurate records also enhance accountability at all levels of drone operations.1

When considering alternatives to a custom-developed DPMS, their limitations become apparent in the context of Drone Solutions' specific needs:

Continuing with the Existing Manual System: This is not a viable long-term solution. As demonstrated, manual processes are inefficient, error-prone, difficult to scale, and pose significant compliance risks that will only intensify as the company grows.

Off-the-Shelf Generic Management Software: While various generic business management or even aviation-specific software solutions exist, they often lack the precise features required for drone pilot management or the specific compliance nuances of CAAZ regulations. Customizing such systems, if possible, can be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming for an SME like Drone Solutions. Furthermore, generic systems might be overly complex, introducing unnecessary features and a steep learning curve.12

Developing a Desktop Application: A desktop-based application would lack the inherent accessibility, ease of deployment, and centralized data management capabilities of a web-based system. Pilots and administrators often require access from different locations (office, field), which is better supported by a web application.

Therefore, the proposed custom-developed, web-based Drone Pilot Management System emerges as the most appropriate, cost-effective (in terms of addressing specific needs without paying for unneeded features), and tailored solution. It is designed to directly meet Drone Solutions' unique operational requirements, integrate seamlessly with their workflows, and ensure robust compliance with the specific regulatory landscape of Zimbabwe. This targeted approach offers the best value proposition by delivering a system that is fit-for-purpose and supports the company's strategic objectives of efficiency, safety, and compliant growth.

2.7. Requirements Analysis

The requirements analysis phase is critical for defining the capabilities and characteristics of the Drone Pilot Management System (DPMS). It involves identifying and documenting both what the system must do (Functional Requirements) and the qualities it must possess while performing those functions (Non-Functional Requirements).22 These requirements are derived from the project objectives, data gathered from Drone Solutions and regulatory documents, and an understanding of user needs.

2.7.1. Functional Requirements (FRs)

Functional Requirements (FRs) specify the explicit actions, tasks, or functionalities that the DPMS must be able to perform to meet user needs and achieve its objectives.40 Each FR listed below is designed to be clear, testable, and unambiguous.

User Management and Authentication:

FR1: The system shall allow authorized System Administrators to create new user accounts for pilots and other administrators, providing necessary profile information.

FR2: The system shall allow System Administrators to view a list of all user accounts and access individual user profiles for review.

2.7.3. Use Case Diagram

A Use Case Diagram provides a high-level visual representation of the interactions between users (actors) and the Drone Pilot Management System (DPMS), illustrating the various functionalities (use cases) the system offers to help actors achieve their goals.50 Standard UML notation is used.

Actors:

Drone Pilot: An employee of Drone Solutions who operates drones and needs to manage their flight logs, certifications, and view schedules.

System Administrator: An employee of Drone Solutions (likely administrative or operations management staff) responsible for managing user accounts, pilot profiles, certifications, drone fleet data, mission scheduling, reviewing logs, and generating reports.

Management User: (Potentially a distinct role or a specialized view for an Administrator) An employee of Drone Solutions in a managerial position who requires oversight of operations through reports and dashboards but does not perform day-to-day data entry or system configuration.

(Implicit External Actor) CAAZ Officer/System: While not directly interacting with the DPMS login, CAAZ is an entity for whom compliance reports are generated. The DPMS prepares data for CAAZ.

System Boundary:The system boundary encompasses all functionalities provided by the Drone Pilot Management System.

Use Case Diagram (Textual Description):(A graphical UML Use Case diagram would be presented here in a full report. The following describes its key elements.)The diagram would show a central rectangle labeled "Drone Pilot Management System" representing the system boundary. Outside this boundary, the actors (Drone Pilot, System Administrator, Management User) would be depicted. Lines (associations) would connect actors to the use case ovals within the system boundary, indicating which actor initiates or participates in which use case.

Key Use Cases:The following are key use cases derived from the functional requirements:

UC1: Authenticate User
